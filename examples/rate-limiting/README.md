# ðŸ“Š Rate limiting

It is possible to configure Nginx in such a way as to limit the number that a client (based on the ip address of the requests) will be able to execute in a given period of time.

To activate this feature, simply edit the `nginx.conf` file according to the template provided in this directory.

Once this is complete, you can proceed with deployment as normal. ðŸš€
